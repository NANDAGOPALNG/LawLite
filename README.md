# LawLite ⚖️
LawLite is a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) designed to simplify complex legal documents into clear, plain-English summaries. Built on top of open-source LLaMA-2-7B model and optimized using LoRA techniques, LawLite helps users quickly understand lengthy contracts, agreements, and compliance documents without legal jargon.

##  About

LawLite empowers users to quickly understand lengthy legal content without getting bogged down by jargon. By leveraging modernization techniques like LoRA or QLoRA, it provides efficient and accessible summaries today.

##  Installation & Setup

> **Note**: The repository doesn’t currently provide specific details on dependencies or setup. You may add the following as needed:

```bash
# Example: set up a Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

**Dependencies may include:**

* `transformers`
* `peft`
* `safetensors`
* `torch`
* Any other libraries used in notebooks or model scripts

## Usage

Although usage instructions are not yet documented in the repo, here’s a suggested template you can adapt:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import PeftModel

# Load base LLaMA-2-7B model
base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf")

# Load LawLite fine-tuned adapter
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "models/finetunnedModel/checkpoint-20")

# Summarize legal text
text = open("data/legal_doc.txt").read()
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
summary_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=300)
print(tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

Update this section based on actual model and script names or notebook examples you include.
